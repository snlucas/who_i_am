# who_i_am

That's a mi card project and it's includes mainly a screen to inputs and a screen to show the info. 

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. I want to make this as a beautiful mi card focused on Material Design.

It's not already finished. You can see the draw screens (blueprints) in the "(Draw)Who_I_am-Mi_Card_App" file
